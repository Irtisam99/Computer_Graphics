# üöÑ A Journey Through City, Hill & Beach: Train Landscapes
A OpenGL project made using C++ in Codeblocks
This project is a Computer Graphics animation developed using OpenGL, replicating three beautiful scenarios inspired by real locations in Bangladesh:

1. City life inspired by Dhaka

2. Hilly terrain inspired by Sylhet

3. Coastal scenery inspired by Cox's Bazar

## üé¨ Project Scenarios
1Ô∏è‚É£ Scenario 1: City Inspired by Dhaka (Main Focus)
Busy roads with cars, buses, pickups

Trains running through the city

Airplanes and birds flying across the sky

A lake with moving boats

Fields, lamp posts, chairs, and green areas adding urban greenery

Realistic traffic movement and object animations

2Ô∏è‚É£ Scenario 2: Hilly Sylhet
Lush green hills and flowing rivers

A Hardinge-like bridge with a moving train

Trucks and buses on countryside roads

Ships crossing the river

A clock tower overlooking the landscape

Rain effect representing the monsoon vibe of Sylhet

3Ô∏è‚É£ Scenario 3: Coastal Cox's Bazar
Beach scenery with waves and sands

Parasailing activities

Marine Drive road along the coastline

Hills and the vast open sea

Coastal vehicles and leisure vibes


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

C++ with OpenGL (GLUT, GLU, GL)

Geogebra (for plotting coordinates and layouts)

BMP textures for enhanced graphics

WAV files for adding sound effects 

Used concepts of line drawing, polygons, animations, and transformations

FreeGlut library
## üéØ Features
Smooth animations of trains, birds, boats, and vehicles

Layered backgrounds with detailed environments

Scene switching between city, hills, and beach

Simple keyboard and mouse controls for certain object movements

Natural effects like rainfall

Balanced mix of infrastructure and nature
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
Make sure you have a C++ compiler, OpenGL and freeglut libraries installed.

Recommended: Code::Blocks


Clone the repository:

--> gitbash


-->git clone https://github.com/Irtisam99/Computer_Graphics.git

**Recommended: Download the whole Zip file 

Open the merged/single file in your IDE 

Run and Compile

To properly switch between the scenarios and also to use keyboard and mouse interactions follow the .md file (KEY_MOUSE_INTERACTIONS.md)
